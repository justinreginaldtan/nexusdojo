## Task
Build a small Python script that delivers on the idea above. Keep it simple and runnable from the command line.

## Suggested steps
1) Run the starter script: `python main.py`
2) Review the seeded smoke test in `tests/test_smoke.py` and make it assert something meaningful.
3) Add the core logic that fulfills the idea plus basic error handling.
4) Fill out `tests/test_edge_cases.py` (currently skipped) with the riskiest paths you can think of.
5) Capture a quick note with `dojo log basic-calculator --note "<what you did>"`

## Testing
```bash
python -m unittest
```
