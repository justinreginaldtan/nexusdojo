# Mission: Develop a simple command-line calculator in Python that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two integers.

## Overview
Develop a simple command-line calculator in Python that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two integers.

## Inputs
- A string representing the first integer
- A string representing the second integer

## Outputs
- An integer representing the sum of the two integers
- An integer representing the difference between the two integers
- An integer representing the product of the two integers
- An float representing the quotient of the two integers (if applicable)

## Constraints
- Error handling must be implemented to gracefully handle exceptions, such as type errors or division by zero.
- Type hints should be used to ensure that the inputs are correctly interpreted.
- The function should be optimized for performance with large input sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria (Tests)
- The function should return the correct result for valid inputs.
- The function should raise a ValueError for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer strings or division by zero).

## Quickstart
1. Read this `MISSION.md` carefully.
2. Implement your solution in `main.py`.
3. Run tests using `dojo check` to verify acceptance criteria.
4. Log your progress: `dojo log <kata-slug> --note "..."`
5. Once complete: `dojo check` to pass all tests, then log your victory!
