# Mission: Write a script to test various functionalities of a given project.

## Overview
Write a script to test various functionalities of a given project.

## Inputs
- A URL pointing to the project's GitHub repository
- A list of files or directories within the project

## Outputs
- A set of test cases for each functionality tested

## Constraints
- Must use Python and pytest
- Test cases should cover all functionality
- Tests should be run on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows)

## Acceptance Criteria (Tests)
- Each test case should pass
- The script should handle errors gracefully
- All tests should be documented

## Quickstart
1. Read this `MISSION.md` carefully.
2. Implement your solution in `main.py`.
3. Run tests using `dojo check` to verify acceptance criteria.
4. Log your progress: `dojo log <kata-slug> --note "..."`
5. Once complete: `dojo check` to pass all tests, then log your victory!
