# # Mission: Write a script to test various functionalities of a given project.
# 
# ## Overview
# Write a script to test various functionalities of a given project.
# 
# ## Inputs
# - A URL pointing to the project's GitHub repository
# - A list of files or directories within the project
# 
# ## Outputs
# - A set of test cases for each functionality tested
# 
# ## Constraints
# - Must use Python and pytest
# - Test cases should cover all functionality
# - Tests should be run on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows)
# 
# ## Acceptance Criteria (Tests)
# - Each test case should pass
# - The script should handle errors gracefully
# - All tests should be documented
# 
# ## Quickstart
# 1. Read this `MISSION.md` carefully.
# 2. Implement your solution in `main.py`.
# 3. Run tests using `dojo check` to verify acceptance criteria.
# 4. Log your progress: `dojo log <kata-slug> --note "..."`
# 5. Once complete: `dojo check` to pass all tests, then log your victory!
