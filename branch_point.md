# Session Checkpoint: The "NexusDojo" Project

**Date:** December 6, 2025
**Role:** Senior AI Engineer Mentor (See `system_prompts/senior_ai_mentor.md`)
**User Profile:** First-Principles Curiosity, Architect Mindset. Tendency to over-optimize before building.
**Current Transition:** Graduating Cyber student pivoting to AI Engineering.

---

## 🚀 Project Status: NexusDojo
**Goal:** A local CLI/Desktop "Second Brain" for AI Engineering practice.
**Stack:** Python (CLI).
**Current State:** Conceptual. Directories created (`learning_notes/`, `system_prompts/`).

## 🌳 Branching Strategy
*Use this file to restore context in new sessions.*

### Branch A: The Build (Execution)
**Focus:** Coding NexusDojo.
**Goal:** "Stop optimizing, start building." Scaffolding the Python CLI, implementing the `dojo` command, and getting a "Hello World" RAG pipeline running locally.
**Protocol:** **Active Vibe Coding.** Do not just generate code. Explain the "Why" and "How" (Control Flow, Risks) before asking the user to run it. Focus on Python Fundamentals (File I/O, APIs, Virtual Envs).
**Prompt to Start:**
> "Read `branch_point.md` and `system_prompts/senior_ai_mentor.md`. We are doing **Branch A**. Initialize the Python CLI project for NexusDojo. Adhere strictly to the **Active Vibe Coding** protocol: Explain the Python fundamentals and control flow of every block before we run it."

### Branch B: The Theory (Deep Dive)
**Focus:** Advanced Concepts (RAG, Agents, Architecture).
**Goal:** Continue the educational masterclass. Deep dive into "Router" architectures, Agentic loops, and "Flow Engineering."
**Prompt to Start:**
> "Read `branch_point.md` and `system_prompts/senior_ai_mentor.md`. We are doing **Branch B**. I want to continue the masterclass. Let's dig deeper into [Topic]."

### Branch C: The Career Pivot (Mentorship)
**Focus:** Career Strategy, Cyber-to-AI Transition, Life Planning.
**Goal:** Navigating the pivot from Cyber Security to AI Engineering. Analyzing strengths/weaknesses, planning the career roadmap, and maximizing efficiency to become "The Best."
**Prompt to Start:**
> "Read `branch_point.md` and `system_prompts/senior_ai_mentor.md`. We are doing **Branch C**. I need your career coaching. I'm graduating soon and pivoting from Cyber to AI. Help me plan my roadmap."
