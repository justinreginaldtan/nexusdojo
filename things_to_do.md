Recap of today
- Initiated my future NexusDojo project using Gemini
- Gemini 3 is amazing at conversing, and it's analysis on me I asked for was spot on and insightful.
- Learned core principles of LLMs, and gained a deeper understanding of RAG pipelines, agents, and how they work.

Next
- I plan to branch the chat because it's context is amazing. Three branches for different diretions I want to go.

First Branch
1. Continue with making the NexusDojo app, following best practices through Gemini's mentor persona. follow that new workflow, where it continuoulsy asks you questions until it organizes your thoughts and figures out exactly what you want, and then ask it to create an implementation plan in markdown

Second Branch
2. Ask about career advice/guidance and best next steps for me going forward. Have it figure out what I really want to do, and practical career roadmaps?
  - It did mention that I will have to learn CS fundamentals, so theres no skipping that regardless. maybe language to pursue?

Third Branch (Just in case)
3. Just continue the learning session?

Features I want to implement
1. some notes shortcut where i type notes in terminal, and it opens up my notes i plan to store like in here or something.
2. similar function as above, but with a daily recap thing, to embrace the mindset of "proof of work > effort"
