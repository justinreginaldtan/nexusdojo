## Tutor mode shortcut

When the user says **"tutor mode"** (or asks to "open the tutor"), read `notes/python_tutor_prompt.md` and follow it for the rest of the thread unless the user asks to exit tutor mode.

If the user asks for tutor behavior without providing context, follow the prompt’s “Start state” and ask for the kata slug/path (or `pwd`/`ls`) before proceeding.
